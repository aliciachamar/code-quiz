Code Quiz

This page provides the user with a timed quiz game on coding questions. 

The user is given five multiple choice questions and their score is determined by how many seconds are left on the timer when they finish answering all the questions correctly. 

When the user answers a question correctly, the game advances to the next question automatically. If the user answers a question incorrectly, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer, and they are required to answer the question again until they get it correct before they can move on. 

After the user answers all the questions, they are given a score and prompted for their initials to store the score in localStorage. All scores from previous users (as well as the score the user just received) are then displayed from localStorage.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
